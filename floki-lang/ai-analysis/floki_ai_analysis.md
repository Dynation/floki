# AI Components for Floki

This directory contains the AI-related components and tools for the Floki programming language.

## Structure

```
AI_analises/
├── monitoring_setup.py      # Basic monitoring infrastructure
├── data_collection.py       # Data collection utilities
├── ai_config.yaml          # AI components configuration
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Configure AI components in `ai_config.yaml`

3. Start monitoring:
   ```python
   from monitoring_setup import FlokiMonitor
   
   monitor = FlokiMonitor()
   # Your Floki application code here
   ```

## Development

To contribute to the AI components:

1. Follow the implementation roadmap in `floki_ai_analysis.md`
2. Submit PRs with tests and documentation
3. Update configuration as needed

## Next Steps

- [ ] Implement basic event pattern recognition
- [ ] Add performance optimization
- [ ] Create training pipeline for ML models
- [ ] Add real-time monitoring dashboard
